## Cyrptography Adventure game
The project, which aim was to spark an interest among young children to pick up computer science, was a part of a University of Bristol Computer Science (MSc Conversion) course, Software Engineering module. 

In a team of 5 people we wrote a simple (*slightly complex*) cryptography adventure game, where player need to solve various puzzles scattered in a 2D world in order to read encrypted messages and find out what happened to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's final 
project. 

The game is was not finished due to the limited amount of time and the code is extremly messy (it was our first time working in a group, not to mention all of us had only 6 months of programming experience!). We got the world sprites mostly from deviantart under creative commerce licence, but puzzle graphics and ADA robot sprite was born in-house :) 

I doubt the code will be of any help to anyone trying to learn how to code games (honestly, we were super unexperienced back then, so it's probably better idea to look elsewhere), but the game has some nostalgic value to us, hence I'm keeping in on github. Since one of us was working on linux, there's a makefile for linux located in CryptoGame/Game01 folder, so feel free to give it a try if you are bored. The rest was on Visual Studio, so there should be the solution file (and exe), but it seems it got ignored by git. [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) is neccessary to run it though. 

The game trailer can be found below.
